Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

// When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
// For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
// since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
