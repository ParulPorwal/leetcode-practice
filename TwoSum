//Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
//You can return the answer in any order.


//Solution 1: creating two loops, iterating in one from index 0 to n-1 and in seconf from 1 to n, if the sum of two indexes equals the result, returning index in a new array. 
//O(N^2)

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length -1; i++){
            for(int j = i +1; j < nums.length; j++){
                if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target){
                    return new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

//solution 2 : use HashMap 
//O(N)
